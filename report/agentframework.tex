\section{CCMP Agent Framework}
The CCMP framework handles the interactions between the ART testbed and the
trust network and decision tree.  Composed of three sections: main agent
class, decision tree and trust network classes.

\subsection{Main Agent}
The main framework class, CCMPAgent, is a subclass of the ART testbed Agent
class thus providing the interface to the ART testbed.  Handles message
passing, provides info to trust network and gets trust values to decision tree
to get decisions on what to do.

\subsection{Trust Network}
Abstract class for representation of the trust the agent has for other players.
Methods to receive updates regarding events in the ART testbed that would have
an effect on trust

\subsection{Decision Tree}
Abstract class that provides direction to the agent on how to behave.  For each
possible action (list actions) the DT has a function to provide direction to
the main agent class.

\subsection{CCMP Agent Flow}
Document interaction process here\ldotsor in Main Agent subsection maybe?
