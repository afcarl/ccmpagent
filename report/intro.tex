\section{Introduction}
The CCMP Agent, for the ART testbed, is a framework that uses two components to
control its behaviour in an evolving multi-agent environment: the Trust Network
and the Decision Tree.  The trust network manages and updates the trust values
for each agent in the ART testbed. The decision tree provides a methodology for
the agent to make decisions on the actions to take based on the knowledge in the
trust network. 

In this project an abstract agent framework was developed to provide the
interactions with the ART testbed and other agents.  This framework makes use
of Java interface classes to work with abstract implementations of the trust
network and decision tree components.  To implement an accurate trust network a
Bayesian approach was used based on the paper B-trust: Bayesian Trust Framework
for Pervasive Computing.  To provide a flexible decision tree environment the Weka Java API
was used to design and execute decision tree graphs.
