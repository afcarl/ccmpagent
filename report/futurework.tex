\section{Future Work}
There are several ideas that were proposed but could not be implemented
in the time frame available.  The first idea is to implement a
methodology for modelling the other agents trust of our agent, the
inferred trust.  This trust could be influenced by keeping track of the
good or bad actions we to do an agent as well as asking the agent about
its reputation for us.  The inferred trust would then become one of the
non-categorical data elements that could affect the actions taken by
the decision tree.

The second idea is to generate decision trees describing the behaviour
of other agents based on their actions.  Theoretically, we could gather
training data capturing the behaviour of other agents over multiple
time steps.  Eventually we could test our developed decision trees of 
other agents to try and predict what actions they are going to take.
Furthermore, we could then devise tactics on how to exploit the 
predicted behaviour of the other agents in order to boost our chances of
winning.
