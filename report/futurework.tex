\section{Future Work}
There are several ideas that were proposed but could not be implemented
in the time frame availabe.  The first idea is to implement a
methodology for modeling the other agents trust of our agent, the
inferred trust.  This trust could be influenced by keeping track of the
good or bad actions we to do an agent as well as asking the agent about
its reputation for us.  The inferred trust would then become one of the
non-categorical data elements that could affect the actions taken by
the decision tree.

The second idea is to generate decision trees on the fly, based on both a
pre-determined method as well as evolving the decision tree based on each
agents actions.  In this approach there would be different decision tree
collections for each agent.
