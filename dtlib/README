Weka Decision Tree 
------------------
Instead of having fixed compiled if-else tree statements, it was decided the use of decision trees would provide
the desired flexibility of being able to specify how decisions are to be made at runtime.  It was clear that
developing this from scratch would be unnecessary as the Weka 3.6.1 [1] open source library 
already contained implementations that meet all the requirements.  These requirements including 
being able to classify data sets and then being able to query the resulting tree to determine the 
categorical action based on the set of non-categorical test.  Also, there was a need to view the resulting tree 
for visual inspection.
