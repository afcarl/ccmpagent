-install MySQL and setup a root user/password
-run startWizard script to configure the DB
-edit a config file in config/ to add agents, change settings
-edit the startSim script to load that config file
-run startSim script, should see nice outputs and populated cvs files in result/
-run startGMI script to view the game outputs

For some reason, the agent class files (not JAR) need to be in src\testbed\participants
The CCMP agent JARs can be anywhere, as can their xml config files, but need to be pointed
to the xml file in the config.xml and the agent xml file must point (absolute or relative from testbed/)
to the JAR file.
