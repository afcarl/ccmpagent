CCMP Agent
----------

The base framework class, CCMPAgent, is the subclass of the ART testbed Agent
and provides the interface to the ART testbed.  The CCMPAgent is
responsible for handling the generation, parsing and responses to the
messages within the testbed Agent methods.  

It does this in a similar and abstract manner for each one. First it parses the
incoming messages and updates the trust network and decision tree on the
results of the messages, either positive or negative.  After updating the
knowledge base regarding the actions of the other agents and passing the new
values from the trust network to the decision tree, it queries the decision tree
to determine what action to take.  It then generates the appropriate
messages and passes them to the sim.

The base CCMPAgent class implements all this functionality in an abstract way
using the base TrustNetwork and DecisionTree classes.  The specific objects
types, such as the Bayesian trust network and Weka decision tree, are
instantiated in subclasses of CCMPAgent.  It is these subclasses that are passed
to the ART testbed for creation in the sim.  In this manner different
implementations of the trust network and decision tree classes can be easily
incorporated into the CCMPAgent.

The agent framework relies upon the dtlib and bayestrustlib projects.
