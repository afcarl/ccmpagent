\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a flexible software design that would allow:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Integration with ART agent framework
    \item Maximum flexibility in approach to trust representation and
    action decisions
    \item Distribution of work among team members
  \end{itemize}
  \item Solution consists of three components
  \begin{itemize}
    \item CCMP Agent Framework - handles ART interactions
    \item Decision Tree libaray based on Weka API
    \item Trust Representation library based on Bayes Theorem
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
