Bayesian Trust Framework
------------------------
To assess our trust in the other peers in the system, we implemented
the model from "B-trust: Bayesian Trust Framework for Pervasive Computing''
[1]. The paper describes a method of maintaining context-sensitive
information about previous direct experiences with other peers as well as
the recommended trust received from third-party recommenders. Trust values
are stored probabilistically and trust evolution from one
experience/recommendation to another uses a form a Bayes' theorem.
